# NaiveBayes-classifier

It is a classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, all of these properties independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple and that is why it is known as ‘Naive’.


Naive bayes classification algorithm is used for predicting the class (Target wait) for the following sample:
##### X= (alt = T, Bat = T, Fri = F, Hun = T, Pat = Some, Price = $$$, Rain = T, Res = T, Type = Italian, Est. > 60).
